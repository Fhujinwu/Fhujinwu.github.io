I am a Third-year master student at Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications (2020~), co-advised by Prof. [Bin Xiao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=e3Dw1bkAAAAJ&hl=en), Associate Prof. [Xiuli Bi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1Ezgfw8AAAAJ&hl=en), Associate Prof. [Junchao Fan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FhHYPaIAAAAJ&hl=en) and Lecturer [Bo Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fXlz210AAAAJ&hl=en). I am also working as an intern at  SMIL Lab, South China University of Technology (from October 2022, ongoing), where I am supervised by Prof. [Mingkui Tan](https://tanmingkui.github.io/). My research interests focus on, but not limited to computer vision, AI4Science and machine learning. Feel free to contact me if you are interested in my research or would like to work together on interdisciplinary research.
