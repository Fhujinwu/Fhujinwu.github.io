I am a Third-year master student at Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications (2020~), co-advised by Prof. [Bin Xiao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=e3Dw1bkAAAAJ&hl=en), Associate Prof. [Xiuli Bi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1Ezgfw8AAAAJ&hl=en) and Lecturer [Bo Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fXlz210AAAAJ&hl=en). I am also working as an intern at South China University of Technology (from October 2022, ongoing), where I am supervised by Prof. [Mingkui Tan](https://tanmingkui.github.io/). My research interests focus on, but not limited to computer vision, image processing and machine learning. Feel free to contact me if you are interested in my research.
